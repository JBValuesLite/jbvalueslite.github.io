# JB Values Lite
Lite version of JB Values

## Added
- Stability and Demand on the card itself (so you dont have to click on it to see them)
- Filtering by demand
- Demands are now based on colors (cards will have different outlined colors)
- 

## Differences
- `Smaller UI` (jb values is too big)
- `Fast redability` (everything is being shown)
- `Prettier` (jb values (actual one)'s color palette is kinda weird)
- `Much optimized code` (specially for filtering)

## Removed "Features"
- `"View More" Button`
- `Dupe List`
- `Calculator`

## Similar Features
- `Minimalistic style`
- `Vehicle / Cosmetics button`
- `Items images`

# Todo
- [ ] Value Filter (by range)
- [X] Sorting (highest value/demand/name)
- [ ] Advanced Sorting (stability, highest trend, others)
